### DESCRIPTION:
  ## This script sets the working environment for the computer on which you are
  #     working. You need to add your own computer and file paths by filling 
  #     in the blanks (________) below! The first entry is an example for my
  #     computer.
  ## This script also creates the initial folder structure used for the
  #     scripts in the spatial-analysis-workflow.

# The following line gives your "nodename", which you will paste into the first
#   blank "________" (line 38)

## For Emily Bruns:

  # I like my main directory in Google Drive for easy sharing; to do this, 
  #   you first need to install "Drive for desktop", see here:
  #   https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/13022292?hl=en
  # It's also totally great to keep everything local and not linked to the cloud!
